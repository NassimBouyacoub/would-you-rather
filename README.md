would you rather is a web app that lets an employee create polls for coworkers. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.


to launch the app you have to install dependencies:

npm install 

and run the app

npm start
